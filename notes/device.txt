Device Class (lve_device.hpp and lve_device.cpp): 
    First in it's constructor, a vulkan instance is created, which initializes the vulkan library and is the connection between the app and vulkan. 

    Next, validation layers 
    (extra error checking becuase vulkan doesn't have a lot of that by default). Remove validation layers in release builds where performance is critical.

    Next, a surface is made which relies on glfw and is the connection between the window and vulkans ability to display results.

    Next, the physical device the app uses is decided (the GPU/iGPU)

    Next, a logical device is created which describes what features of the device the program wants to use.

    Finally, it's convienent to setup the command pool for later use, which will help with command buffer allocation.

"LveDevice &lveDeice" Description
    Could be memory unsafe if our device (GPU) is released from memory before the pipeline (assembly line), this could still be attempted to be dereferenced, which would cause a crash. So the only 
    time a reference type  member (a variable that is part of a class/object and is a reference (has & before it)) is when there is an implied relationship that the meber variable (in this case the 
    device) will outlive any instances of the containing class (the class that it is a member of) that depend on it. So it should only be used when it's implied that it will last past the class that
    it's part of that depends on it. This is because a pipeline NEEDS a device to exist.

VkPipeline graphicsPipeline is the handle (interface I think) to the pipeline object.

VkShaderModule vertShaderModule (for vertex shader)
VkShaderModule fragShaderModule (for fragment shader)

Since the pipeline class is responsible for managing the lifetime of these things, a destructor (~LvePipeline() {})  is made. Also, the copy constructors are deleted now do avoid duplicating
the pointers to the vulkan objects.

static PipelineConfigInfo defaultPipelineConfigInfo(uint32_t width, uint32_t height):
    creates default pipeline config.
